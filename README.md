# Uncommon Tcl Error: Misunderstanding of error Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Tcl's error handling that can be easily overlooked. The `error` command is used to signal an error, but the specific behavior depends on the context in which it's called.

## The Bug
The `bug.tcl` file contains a procedure, `error_example`, that checks for a negative input. If the input is negative, an error is raised using the `error` command. However, the error handling might not behave as expected in all scenarios. The `main` section calls `error_example` with a negative input, demonstrating the unexpected behavior.  The error message is not directly handled and might terminate the script unexpectedly or not gracefully handle the error depending on the calling context.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.tcl` file demonstrates a solution to this problem.  It involves better error handling, possibly using `catch` to trap errors and handle them more gracefully.  This allows the script to continue execution or provide appropriate feedback to the user without abrupt termination.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.tcl` using a Tcl interpreter (like tclsh).
3. Observe the unexpected behavior (script termination or lack of error feedback).
4. Run `bugSolution.tcl` to see the improved error handling and behavior.
